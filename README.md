# Kubernetes on KVM

Deploy (small) Kubernetes clusters on KVM, all from scratch! üöÄ

## ‚úÖ Pre-requisites

* KVM (see your favourite Linux distribution how-to)
* OpenTofu (the `terraform` fork)

## üóíÔ∏è Important notes

* See the `scripts/` folder for various utility scripts.
* You probably want to change `user` and `group` to `libvirt-qemu` and `kvm` respectively in `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` to mitigate permission issues on storage pools.
* All cluster nodes will be running Ubuntu 24.04.

## üèÉ Getting started

### Provision cluster nodes

By default we'll deploy a cluster on three nodes, they will have both the control-plane and worker roles.

_If you're setting a lower resource values on each node then you might need to set: `--ignore-preflight-errors=mem,numcpu` during `kubeadm init`._

1. Change the `k8s.auto.tfvars` to fit your needs!
2. Run `tofu init`
3. Run `tofu plan`
4. Run `tofu apply`
5. The needed nodes shall be provisioned with everything included for you to start bootstrapping the cluster.

### Accessing the nodes

_Remember to start your VMs after a reboot!_

#### SSH to one node a time

To find out the IP addresses of the VMs you can run the following using `virsh`:

```bash
sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases k8s_net
```

#### SSH using the provided helper script

This requires that you have [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed.

```bash
PRIVATE_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/kvm-k8s scripts/ssh.sh
```

_Make sure you're using the private key that matches the public key added as part of the cluster node provisioning. We're adding a user called `cloud` by default that has the provided public key as one of the `ssh_authorized_keys`._

#### Using `tmux` and `xpanes` to SSH to all available nodes

Don't forget to inline the private key path below and replace `<PRIVATE_KEY>` before running the command:

```bash
tmux

sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases k8s_net | tail -n +3 | awk '{print $5 }' | cut -d"/" -f1 | xpanes -l ev -c 'ssh -l cloud -i <PRIVATE_KEY> {}'
```

### Bootstrap the first control-plane node

_Please note that we're skipping the addon `kube-proxy` since in these clusters we want to utilize Cilium as the CNI and with a configuration that replaces the need for `kube-proxy`._

```bash
CONTROL_PLANE_IP=$(ip addr show ens3 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "$CONTROL_PLANE_IP:6443" --upload-certs
```

### Add a worker node

Add worker nodes to the cluster:

1. Generate the join command on a control-plane node:

```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

2. Use the generate join command and run that on the worker node.

### Upgrade cluster

_As of writing this the clusters are deployed with the latest available patch release of `v1.30`. The following guide will upgrade the cluster to `v1.31.2`._

1. Add the following line to the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list`, note the Kubernetes version:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/ /" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```

2. Run `apt update`.

3. Check which install candidate we have: `apt policy kubeadm`

```bash
kubeadm:
  Installed: 1.30.6-1.1
  Candidate: 1.31.2-1.1
  Version table:
 *** 1.31.2-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb  Packages
     1.31.1-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb  Packages
     1.31.0-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb  Packages
     1.30.6-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
     1.30.5-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
     1.30.4-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
     1.30.3-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
     1.30.2-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
     1.30.1-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
     1.30.0-1.1 500
        500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
```

4. Install a newer version `kubeadm`:

```bash
apt install kubeadm=1.31.2-1.1
```

5. Drain and cordon the control-plane node:

```bash
kubectl drain <node name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data --disable-eviction
```

_Use `--disable-eviction` flag with caution, in this case we'll have a small test cluster which most likely wont accomodate for any Pod Distruption Budgets configured._

6. Check the upgrade `plan` and proceed with upgrade:

```bash
kubeadm upgrade plan
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.31.2
```

```bash
[upgrade/version] You have chosen to change the cluster version to "v1.31.2"
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.30.6
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.31.2
[upgrade] Are you sure you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
```

7. Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`:

```bash
apt install kubelet=1.31.2-1.1 kubectl=1.31.2-1.1
```

8. Continue with the rest of the control-plane nodes.

Check versions:

```bash
kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.2
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
Server Version: v1.31.2

kubectl get nodes
NAME         STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
k8s01-cp01   Ready    control-plane   4d21h   v1.31.2
k8s01-w01    Ready    <none>          4d20h   v1.30.6
```

_Please note that for workers you'll only install a newer version of the `kubelet`!_

### Clean up the cluster

Run the clean-up utility script: `scripts/clean_up.sh`, please note that this removes everything related to the VMs and `tofu` state.

## üìö Add-ons

### Install Cilium

```bash
./scripts/install_cilium.sh
```

_Note that we run Cilium with `kubeProxyReplacement=true` with `kube-proxy` running, you could remove all things related to `kube-proxy` [manually](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/kubeproxy-free/#quick-start) or skip the `kube-proxy` phase during `kubeadm init`._

### Install Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper

1. Install:

```bash
./scripts/install_opa.sh
```

2. Create a constraint template and a constraint:

```bash
kubectl create -f manifests/opa/image-constraint.yaml
```
gst
